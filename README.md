ðŸ”¢ Digit Recognition with MNIST using ANN
This repository contains a deep learning-based solution for handwritten digit classification using the MNIST dataset. The project leverages an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built with TensorFlow/Keras to achieve high accuracy in recognizing digits (0â€“9) from 28x28 grayscale images.
ðŸ“š About the Project:
The MNIST dataset is a benchmark in the machine learning community, containing:
60,000 training images
10,000 test images
Each image is a 28x28 grayscale representation of a handwritten digit.

In this project:
ANN is built using Keras Sequential API
Input data is scaled and reshaped for training
The model is trained, validated, and tested
Performance is evaluated using metrics and visualizations

ðŸ§  Model Architecture
